### Difference between Link, useNavigation, and redirect.

1. Link is a component used to navigate between routes within your React application without reloading the page.

2) useNavigation is a hook that provides information about the current navigation state in react-router-dom. Itâ€™s especially helpful when using loaders or waiting for data to be fetched before rendering a component. `useNavigation returns an object with properties like state (loading, idle, or submitting) that lets you know the current status of the navigation.`.
   `navigate allows us to move to a new route after an asynchronous operation, like handling a form submission, without reloading the page.`

```
import { useNavigation } from "react-router-dom";

const Blog = () => {
const navigation = useNavigation();

if (navigation.state === "loading") {
return <p>Loading...</p>; // Display loading state
}

return <div>Your blog content here</div>;
};

```

3. Redirect is a function used to programmatically navigate to another route, typically in loader or action functions on the server side.

### Todo

1. category based on (puma, adidas, nike) - schema implement
2. cloudinary,
3. read redux more (connect)
